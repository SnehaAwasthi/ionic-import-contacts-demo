# Ionic Import Contacts Demo

Just a place to save a demo of how to import contacts into an ionic application on an iOS device. Check out the blog post at http://www.austinknight.net

# Developing

    Initial setup

    > git clone git@github.com:austinknight/ionic-import-contacts-demo.git
    > sudo npm install -g ionic (if you don't already have ionic)
    > npm install
    > bower install


    Compile changes before emulating

    > ionic build ios

    Run a web server version of the app (contacts won't work on web though)

    > ionic serve
